My name is Ella Blank, and I am a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences, majoring in Communications with a concentration in Data & Network Science and minoring in Political Science. I enrolled in Introduction to Digital Humanities not just to satisfy the Humanities & Social Science Sector requirement but because I was drawn to exploring how technology and data intersect with the humanities. My studies in Communications tend to focus on social networks and traditional media, so the idea of applying digital tools to literary texts and archival work felt new and exciting. I can confidently say this course met these expectations.
